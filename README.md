# MLB Season Leaders (2020-2024) — Scraping & Analysis

## Purpose
Develop a web scraping pipeline to collect data from at least five web pages, clean it, and store it in a Pandas DataFrame. Perform and visualize data analysis using Seaborn to answer at least four questions, including two shown through labeled and styled plots.

## Analysis Questions Answered
1. Who were the top 5 home run hitters in each MLB season?
2. Which teams had the highest combined OPS each year?
3. Which team has more than 100 wins for two consecutive years or more?
4. Who were the top 5 pitchers with more strikeouts in each MLB season?
